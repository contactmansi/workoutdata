## Python Data Science Resources

1. ### [Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

This website contains the full text of the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/) by Jake VanderPlas; the content is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

2. ### [Data Mining Techniques](https://blog.galvanize.com/four-data-mining-techniques-for-businesses-that-everyone-should-know/)

<hr>


## Neural Network and Deep Learning Resources

1. ### [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)

This is an interactive open-source book with codem math, and discussions drafted in Jupyter Notebooks. Interactive website helps to learn by doing. Implementations of all neural network architectures with PyTorch, NumPy/MXNet, and TensorFlow.

## NLP Resources

1. ### [NLP 101: Word2Vec â€” Skip-gram and CBOW](https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-101-word2vec-skip-gram-and-cbow-93512ee24314)

Very rightly stated by author Ria Kulshrestha. This post is *"A crash course in word embedding."*
